# lemonade

Yet another **Load Balancer** implemented in ***Rust Programming Language***!

## Introduction

This project is a deeper dive into **Rust**, named after the analogy of the **manager** of the ***coolest ever lemonade stand***.

> The lemonade stand is so popular that its has a huge line of thirsty customers every single day. From only a single window opened at first, it worked so well that the business is expanding, deciding to open many more identical windows and even extending its offers to other products like cookies, smoothies...
> 
> So comes in the super-organized manager, who stands in front of the group of windows and direct incoming customers to their respective window, making everything faster and more reliable for everyone using the appropriate playbook.
